Create an abstract class called Shape with pure virtual members called calcPerimeter and calcArea. Create subclasses of Shapecalled Rectangle and Trianglethat inherited the pure virtual members above. 

Write two non-member functions called printPerimeter and printArea that call the methods calcPerimeter and calcArea respectfully.

Instantiate a Rectangle and a Triangle object.

Input the length and width of a rectangle and then call the functions printPerimeter and printArea.

Input the length of the three sides of a triangle and then call the functions printPerimeter and printArea.

Output the perimeter and area of the rectangle and triangleobjects.
