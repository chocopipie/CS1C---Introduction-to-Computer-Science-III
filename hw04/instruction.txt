Write and test a friend function that checks to see if the phone numberof a C1SCEmployee object is equal to thephone numberof a Programmerobject.Test equal and not equal scenarios.(You will need to call your ChangePhoneNumber method)
Overload the equality operator to see if the phone numberof two C1SCEmployees are the same.  Test equal and not equal scenarios.(You will need to call your ChangePhoneNumber method)
Write an addition member function that adds an integer to a CS1Cemployee’sage (make sure the integer is a passed parameter).  The output should state how many years were added to the age.
Overload the addition operator to add a constant to a CS1Cemployee’sage. For example: StarC1SCEmployee =StarC1SCEmployee +2.  The output should state how many years were added to the age.
Overload << and >> operators to read in a CS1Cemployeeobject (e.g. cin >> myEmployeeand cout << myEmployee)
Overload the pre & post increment operators to increment an CS1Cemployee’s age. Test pre/post increment operations. Output the values of CS1Cemployeeobjects before and after pre/post increment operations as well as after assignment takes place. Demonstrate how pre/post increment operators are different. Which overloaded operator incurs the most overhead?
