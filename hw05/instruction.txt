Answer the following questions regarding STL and the vector container:
  What is the STL? What is a vector?
  Which vector operations change the size of a vector after its construction?
  What is the STL arraycontainer and how does it differ from the built-in array and from a vector?
  How doesthe vector member functionresize()differ from reserve()?
  What should begin()and end()do for a container?
  Give an example of using the vector push_back()modifier.
  
Write the following program using a vector:
  A common game is the lottery card. The card has numbered spots of which a certain number are selected at random. Write a Lotto()function that takes two arguments. The first   should be the number of spots on a lottery card and the second should be the number of spots selected at random. The function should return a vector<int> object that contains, in sorted order, the numbers selected at random. Use your functionas follows:
            Vector<int> winners;
            winners = Lotto(51,6);
This would assign to winners a vector that contains six numbers selected randomly from the range 1 through 51. Note that simply using rand()doesnâ€™t quite do the job because it may produce duplicate values. 


Suggestion: Have the function create a vector that contains all the possible values, use random_shuffle(), and then use the beginning of the shuffled vector to obtain the values. Also write a short program that lets you test the function.
