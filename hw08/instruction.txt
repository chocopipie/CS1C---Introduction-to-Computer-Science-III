Answer the following questions by modifying the hw08.cpp source file and/or answering the question directly:
  1.Complete Q#1 pointer examples. Complete Q#1 reference examples. Indicate if an operation is not allowed and explain why. Complete the implementations for the increment functions (i.e. increment_value, increment_pointer, increment_reference). Describe what a pointeris. Describe what a reference is. Whatâ€™s the difference between a pointer and a reference?
  2.[read POINTER ARITHMETIC <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointer_arithmatic.htm>, watch  POINTER ARITHMETIC <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCgl88hyzY>] Complete Q#2 pointer arithmetic examples. Indicate if an operation is not allowed and explain why.
  3.[read ARRAYS AND FUNCTIONS <https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx9a.html>, watch POINTERS AND DYNAMIC MEMORY <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-ht2AKyH4&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_&index=12>, POINTERS AND 2D ARRAYS <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcnvZA2u88&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_&index=10>] Complete the function definition for the print_2darray_pointerfunction. How is the twoDDoubles2d array laid out in memory? Why is it necessary to cast twoDDoublesto adouble*in the print_2darray_pointerfunction call?
  4.Complete the dynamic allocation examples.Indicate if an operation is not allowed and explain why.How do the delete statements at [4.7], [4.8] affect the values of variables ri, ri2, ri3? Add the needed delete statement in thefunction definition fordynamic_allocation_array_doubles; this will prevent the function from leaking memory. Add the needed delete statement at [4.9] to ensure the array_of_doublesreturned from the call to dynamic_allocation_array_doublesis freed.
  5.Complete the function definition for the print_2darray_dynamic_pointerfunction. How is the p_p_tictactoe2d dynamic array laid out in memory (i.e. why is p_p_tictactoean int**)? Why do we need to pass a pointer to a pointer of type int in the print_2darray_dynamic_pointerfunction call?
