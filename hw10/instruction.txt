Answer the following questions by modifyingthe hw10.cpp source file and/or answering the question directly:
1. Read [COPY CONSTRUCTORS, ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS, AND EXCEPTION SAFE ASSIGNMENT] http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/y8hv0pDG/, read [C++ COPY CONSTRUCTOR] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_copy_constructor.htm, complete the implementation of the vector class copy constructor. Answer Q#1 related questions listed in main.
2. Read [COPY CONSTRUCTORS, ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS, AND EXCEPTION SAFE ASSIGNMENT] http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/y8hv0pDG/, read [C++ COPY CONSTRUCTOR] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_copy_constructor.htm, complete the implementation of the vector class copy assignment operator. Answer Q#2 related questions listed in main.
3. Read [MOVE SEMANTICS AND RVALUE REFERENCES IN C++11] https://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-in-c++11.html, read [MOVE CONSTRUCTORS AND MOVE ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS C++] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/move-constructors-and-move-assignment-operators-cpp?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=msvc-160, complete the implementation of the vector class move constructor.
4. Read [MOVE SEMANTICS AND RVALUE REFERENCES IN C++11] https://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-in-c++11.html, read [MOVE CONSTRUCTORS AND MOVE ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS C++] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/move-constructors-and-move-assignment-operators-cpp?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=msvc-160, complete the implementation of the vector class move assignment operator.
5. What is the difference between a copy and move operation? What happens when the temp vector (in function scope) is returned (by value) from the fill_doublesfunction and assigned to v6 in main? Is the copy or move constructor invoked? How does this result in improved performance?
