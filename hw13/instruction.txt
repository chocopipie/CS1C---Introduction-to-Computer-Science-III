Using HW12:
  1.Test the assert macro (both pass and fail); print a corresponding output statement.
  2.Add exceptions to the queue template.  
      a.Throw an exceptionif the capacity is exceeded. Print an appropriate error message in the associated exception handler.
      b.Throw an exceptionifyourprogram tries to remove from an empty queue. Print an appropriate error message in the associated exception handler.
      c.Test both exceptions
      
Following an exception, the program should allow one to recover from a mistake without corrupting the contents of the queue.
