1.Create a doublylinked listwith at least five nodes using a class template with template methods
    a.Print the linked list
    
2.Add a copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator to the linked list
    a.Test the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator
    
3.Read the linked list from part 1 and create another linked list reversing the logical order of the first linked list
    a.Print the linked list
    
4.Delete the third node of each list. (Also try to (1) delete a non-existent node and (2) delete from an empty list)
    a.Print both linked lists
    
5.Add a node in the middle of each linked list
    a.Print both linked lists
    
6.Repeat steps 1-4 using doubles

7.Run valgrindto test for memory leaks

Sample printout (similar output for doubles):
Part 1:Linked list 1:  88 78 62 143 60
Part 2:Linked list 1 copy constructor:  88 78 62 143 60
       Linked list 1 copy assignment:  88 78 62 143 60
Part 3:Linked list 2:  60 143 62 78 88
Part 4 (after deleting the third node):
       Linked list 1:  88 78 143 60
       Linked list 2:  60 143 78 88
