Obtain the following string: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (as input or using initialization)
Using recursion, write a reverse function that reverses the characters in a string or character array given two indices (starting and ending).  The string or the character array should reflect the reversal.
Read indices as input11,18 (i.e. letters 12,19)
Call the reversefunction to reverse letters: 12-19
Read indices as input 4,22 (i.e. letters 5,23)
Call the reversefunction to reverse letters: 5,23
Using the reverse function, reverse the alphabet
Print the reversed string or character array.
Your output should contain:
  abcdefghijksrqponmltuvwxyz
  abcdwvutsrqponmlkjihgfexyz
  zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
